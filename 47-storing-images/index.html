    <p>
    Oh no! You've been jettisoned from your airplane and are hurtling to earth.
    Luckily, you've spotted a familiar shaped island below that you may be able
    guide your parachute towards. The trouble is, it's incredibly windy and you
    keep flying off course. It's almost as though something, (or someone!?) is
    against you.
    </p>

    <p>
    Can you battle the wind and make your way safely onto the island below?
    Choose a direction in which to steer your parachute and see where the wind
    takes you! Good luck. You'll need it.
